                <P>Hello, I'm Abibat, i am new to the food blogging space which features delicious, family friendly recipes with some detailed step-by-step preparation methods.
                    How did I get here? Well, Iâ€™ve always been very passionate about cooking but it never occurred to me to start a blog before now, though I was always nudged by friends to do so. My passion for cooking different recipes began earlier in my formative years. I realized that even when i get home after a long day at work and tired to the teeth, immediately i enter my kitchen to make a meal i get energetic and feel rejuvenated.</P>
                <p>My love for cooking and exploring the food world started when i was in primary school,while watching my grandma whip up delicious meals,and making it look very seemless.</p>
                <p>I was always eager to help her with meal preps and she always obliged.
                 Growing up in a home with 5 girls and being the last of them,i knew it would take a while for kitchen duties to be mine,but because my parent saw the love i had for cooking and experimenting with food i was encouraged to start early</p>
                 <p>As i got older i started watching food network and that led to my culinary journey.I learnt a few things which i would like to share.</p>
                 <h2>Things i learnt along the way</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Without passion for cooking, it will be a chore not an hobby pleasure is derived from.</li>
                <li>Technique is everything in cooking, once it gets mastered.</li>
                <li>As long as the technique is mastered experimenting with different ingredients becomes easier.</li>
                <li>Travelling expands your horizon in the culinary world.</li>
                <li>There is nothing as satisfying as watching people eat the meal you prepared and loving it.</li>
            </ol>
